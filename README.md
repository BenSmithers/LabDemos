# Unit 6: Rotational Equilibrium 

This is a little demo to play around with torque and rotational equilibrium

## Requirements:
 - Python 3
 - Numpy 
 - PyQt5 

These should be easy to download with your package manager 

## Instructions: 

Launch file using `python launch.py` or `./launch.py`

 - The circle is 10 inches in radius
 - You can add masses by clicking the "place new button." They are created at the coordinates shown and with the mass shown. 
 - You can move the masses around by clicking and dragging
 - by clicking on a mass, its coordinates and mass is shown. You need to click right at the center! There is a slight tolerance but not a lot. 
 - The color of the circle represents how imbalanced it is. The more red, the less balanced. The more green, the more balanced. 
 - An arrow is drawn representing the current net torque on the system.
